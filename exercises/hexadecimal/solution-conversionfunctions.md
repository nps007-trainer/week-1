|**Requirement**|**Notes**|**Percent Weight**|**Points**|
|--|--|--|--|
|strtol() Implementation|	Correctly uses strtol() to convert a string representation of an integer to a long value. Handles different bases (e.g., decimal, hexadecimal, octal) for input strings. Demonstrates understanding of the endPtr parameter.|30%|	|
|Error Handling for strtol()| Detects and handles failed conversions (e.g., invalid input strings). Provides appropriate error messages or behavior.	|20%|	|
|sprintf() Usage	|Utilizes sprintf() to format output into a character buffer. Stores the formatted output instead of printing it directly. Demonstrates understanding of the syntax and usage of sprintf()|	20%|	|
|Readability|	Well-organized code with clear variable naming and consistent indentation. Effective use of comments where necessary.	|10%| |
|Overall functionality| The application successfully converts strings to long values and formats output using sprintf(). Demonstrates a solid understanding of both functions.|20%| |
