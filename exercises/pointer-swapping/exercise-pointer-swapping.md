# Exercise: Swapping of Two numbers using Pointers

**Length as Designed:** 30 minutes

## Introduction

In this exercise, we will write a C program to swap two numbers using pointers. Pointers allow us to directly manipulate memory addresses, making it possible to modify variables indirectly. Swapping values using pointers is a common operation in programming.

Swapping is the process of interchanging the values of two variables. In other words, swapping the values of two variables means that the value of the first variable is assigned to the second variable and the value of the second variable is assigned to the first variable.


In C programming, there are different ways to swap two numbers. We will use C pointers to swap two numbers.

In C language, pointers are used to store the memory address of other variables. They are declared by putting an asterisk(*) symbol before the variable name, for eg. *myPtr.

When we assign a variable to a pointer, the pointer holds the memory address of that variable. So, if we make any changes to the variable, these changes directly reflect on the pointer or vice versa.

### Requirements
The program takes two numbers from the user as input, stores these numbers in variables a and b, and swaps their values after executing.

### Sample Input:
`Enter the value of a and b: 10 20`

**Output**
```markdown
Before swapping a = 10 and b = 20
After swapping a = 20 and b = 10
```
**Conclusion**
This exercise will help you understand use of Pointers and memory manipulation handling user inputs and implementing swapping logic.
