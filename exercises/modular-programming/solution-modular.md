Use the percentages to distribute the total points for the exercise.

|**Requirement**|**Notes**|**Percent Weight**|**Points**|
|--|--|--|--|
|Modular Programming|	Program is divided into separate source (`calculator.c`) and header (`calculator.h`) files.|20%|	|
|Header File (`calculator.h`)|Header file contains appropriate preprocessor directives (#ifndef, #define, #endif).	|10%|	|
| | Header file contains function declaration (add, subtract, multiply, divide).|15% | |
|Source File (`calculator.c`)	|Source file defines functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) correctly.|	25%|	|
|Main Program (`main.c`)|`main.c` includes necessary header file (#include "calculator.h").|10%| |
|Functionality|Program correctly computes results for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.|10%| |
|Error Handling|Program handles potential errors, such as division by zero, appropriately.| 5%| |
|Readability|	The code is well-organized and easy to read, featuring clear variable naming, consistent indentation, and strategic use of whitespace and comments for better understandability.	|5%| |
