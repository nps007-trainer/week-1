### Exercise: Program that consists of multiple source files and header files; implement a simple calculator functionality with functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division


**Length as Designed:** 30 minutes

## Introduction
In this exercise , you have to implement a Program that consists of multiple source files and header files. Implement a simple calculator functionality with functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Separating code into source (.c) and header (.h) files allows for better organization and encapsulation of functionalities, leveraging the `#include` directive to integrate modules seamlessly.

### Starter Files

**Conclusion**
modular programming and separation of code into files using source and header files are essential practices in software development. By dividing a program into smaller, cohesive modules and using header files to provide interfaces, developers can enhance code clarity, reusability, and maintainability. The #include directive facilitates the integration of modules, enabling collaboration and modularization benefits across large-scale projects. Embrace modular programming principles to streamline development processes, optimize code organization, and foster efficient software solutions in C programming.
