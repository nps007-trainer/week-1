# Knowledge Checks Folder

In this folder, you place quizzes, written assignments, and other knowledge check activities that are not technical source code.

Quizzes should have numbered questions and bold answers. If the quiz question requires an image or other asset, create an _assets subfolder in this directory to hold it.

**Example**

1. Do you like technology?
   - **Yes**
   - No

Written checks should have the prompt shown to the learner and guidance on what the answer is looking for.

**Example**

Prompt: What are the components of declaring a variable in C#?

Guidance: We seek answers specifying a type and a variable name or identifier.
